                   <p>My Testimonial</p> 
                   <p>We are blessed for being part of this wondrous opportunity in learning parts of Digital Citizenship (ICT). I admit that a lot of my learning’s from college about ICT is long gone. There are quite simple manipulations in computer that I can only remember. So, I am thankful that I am part of this project conducted by the joined forced of Alternative Learning System (ALS) Manolo Fortich Districts 1-4 to Northern Bukidnon State College (IT Department).</p>
                   <p>My goals in learning ICT were twofold: to acquire practical skills that could be applied in real-world scenarios and to develop a deeper understanding of the underlying principles driving technological innovation. These goals guided my learning path, shaping the courses I pursued, the projects I will took in the future, and most especially I can rely my learning to my future learners. </p>
                   <P>Reflecting on my journey in learning ICT since day 1 has been a profound exercise, filled with moments of discovery, challenges, and growth. I began my journey with a basic understanding of technology, intrigued by its potential but lacking in-depth knowledge. My initial steps involved exploring fundamental concepts such as hardware, software, networking, and programming languages.</P>
                   <P>One of the most rewarding aspects of my ICT journey has been the opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world contexts. I'm proud of how far I've come these days of my ICT journey. I've acquired a diverse range of skills, from programming languages like web development frameworks such as HTML & CSS. It was mind blowing, patience wrecking journey but worth it. Got the new skills and manipulation in using Microsoft Excel and Spreadsheet that can make your work much easier and faster. Parts of the computer that I haven’t known before and its functions. On how delicate our computers are. How to take good care of it and make a long life or usage on your computer. I am not contented to the time allotment given to us to learn this complicated topic in HTML and CSS. It is still puzzled me up to this time. How I wish we can have another chance to learn further more about this topic.</P>
